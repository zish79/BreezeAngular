This is a Single Page Application totally developed by me using Agular with Breeze and .net . I have also implemented 
Local storage Cache in this project. When application is loaded first time all data is loaded in a local cache of browser
in the format of JSON and later on when any page is opened , request goes to local cache and fetch the data from there.

You can also create the speaker and sessions there even if you are offline.
